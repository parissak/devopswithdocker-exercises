I decided to use Fly.io because I had used their services before. For the web app, I chose the coursepage material.

I followed their [instructions](https://fly.io/docs/languages-and-frameworks/dockerfile/). The deployment process was simple: I created the Dockerfile, launched the Fly.io CLI with ```fly launch``` in the same directory, verified the details, and then waited for the deployment to complete.

Here is the link to the deployed app: <https://flyio-docker.fly.dev/>.
